## Introduction

During my final year at university I was getting deeper into investing and the online community surrounding it. It was a time where people had assets in all sorts of different places: stocks, etf's, crypto, property, and more. I was dabbling in a few asset classes and started to find it annoying switching between all the different investment platforms to see how my portfolio was doing that day. After doing some research I found the only viable place's to do this in New Zealand were [Sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/) which started at $20 a month and [Yahoo Finance](https://nz.finance.yahoo.com/portfolios/) which had a clunky and confusing user experience. After seeing this I decided to start work on a solution.

## Ticker Tracker

Ticker Tracker was the solution I had been looking for. A simple solution where you could view all you assets together to see a snapshot of how they performed. I posted the platform to a number of subreddits ([PersonalFinanceNZ](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceNZ/comments/nfys7y/tracking_your_whole_portfolio_made_easier/), [fiaustralia](https://www.reddit.com/r/fiaustralia/comments/njoox7/tracking_your_whole_portfolio_made_easier/), [ausstocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/ausstocks/comments/njopbp/tracking_your_whole_portfolio_made_easier/)) and got really positive feedback! I implemented a number of feature requests from the comments and fixed bugs as they came up.

- The Managing Director of [BusinessDesk](https://businessdesk.co.nz/) reached out for a potential collaboration
- Hatch Invest reached out in a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceNZ/comments/nfys7y/comment/gz7fhts/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) saying they shared it around the office and the team thought it was very cool.
- A number of software engineers reached out to see if they could help build the platform.

I onboarded over 600 new users that week and had a total of more than 10,000 page views. This was all super exciting and really showcases the gap for a product like this.

One of the people that reached out took their proposal seriously. They outlined a vision for the project, how they could assit in realising that vision and their qualifications. They were a experienced designer with a number of successful entrapenurial ventures. The vision looked good so after a cofounder agreement was signed we jumped into development of **Hedges**

## Hedges

The start of development was smooth and I was making quick progress on the core platform. We were doing project management through Notion and Trello, having weekly catchups to discuss progress, and delegating responsibilities based on our skillset.

The breakdown was essentially me doing all software development and him doing everything else.

Within about 6 months we had something mostly functional that looked great but just had a few bugs left to iron out. Before being able to get the MVP out there we dropped the project. Why was that?

## Why it Didn't Work

It was a pretty multi facitied decision like it always is but I'll list a few reasons here

### Scope Creep

This was probably the biggest reason in my opinion. As you may have processed earlier in the post, we had been working on this platform for 6 months without releasing anything to users. The scope was just massive!

What we ended up deciding on was a fully function portfolio tracker with Shares and ETF, Crypto, Property, Cash, and Custom assets. Shares, ETFs and Crypto would all have live price, historical data, and fundamental data. All of these assets would be accounted for in a graph that showcased this historical value of your portfolio. There would also be mutiple portfolios with custom ordering and sorting. The amount of complexity was insane which led to incredibly difficult debugging.

Bugs were coming up left and right and development really slowed towards the tail end of the project.

**What we should have done**: Kept the scope small (i.e. just stocks and ETFs), got it in front of users, and iterated from there.

### Percived Inequity in Workload

As I outlined in the scope creep section the project got very complicated and time consuming. Another point to note is that once the design work was done and the business plan was laid out it didn't seem like there was much for my business partner to do. This led to the weekly meeting including me talking about all the work I was doing and my partner talking about areas the project needed to be improved.

This project was 50/50 so I just felt like our contributions didn't match that which made me pretty apathetic by the end of things.

**What we should have done**: Got users involved earlier and found more things for the non technical founder to do.

### Financial Data Headaches

For all of the data that was required for the platform it was going to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. Even just for the MVP vision of stocks and ETFs the licencing for NZX and ASX data was going to be $40k or more EACH. And thats just licencing, we would need to go to another broker to get the data in API form which would run thousands more per year. The cost was astronomical.

I now see why it's pretty much just ShareSight. The barrier to entry is rediculous.

**What we should have done**: The only way we could have solved this problem was to take the project extremely seriously and gone for venture funding. No Indie Hacking allowed on this one.

### Life Got Busy

I started my graduate position and Xero and he had his second child. Our priorities moved away from being the next big startup founder and onto other things. We both deprioritied the project and with that it faded away into obscurity.

**What we should have done**: Not much you can do sometimes.

## Conclusion

Working on Ticker Tracker and then Hedges was some of the most fun I've had period. I learned so much about building something simple, getting feedback, increasing the vision, working with business partners, deciding when to end things, and so much more. It gave me an invaluable foundation for future opportunites and opened my eyes to the world of entrapenuership. Who knows what in store next!
